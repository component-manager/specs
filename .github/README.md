# This Github Repo
Is Contains parts of the DIREKTSPEED OCI Alternativ SPECS called Stealify Modules.
It is a OCI Compatible Standard as it can get converted vice versa with some overhead.

The Stealify Module Spec is Web 4.0 Compatible and implements the Web 4.0 Fundamental Component System.

It covers mainly Integrity Checking and Reference Patterns based on protocols if no protocol is specificated we fall back to the current protocol used in the current component task process or how ever you define program execution Stealify uses always the term Launch while it maybe some time adds also alternativ terms to make it more easy to read. For people that are not familar with the Stealify Ecosystem or Fundamentals. 

the main protocol is DIREKTSPEED Versions which is a Superset of the GIT Protocol extended to suite the needs of the Web 4.0.
Mainly added Automated Workflows that are needed to turn git into a Distributed Web InterOp FileSystem.

In general the Stealify Module System can be used with any AwesomeOS Runtime and the definition of a AwesomeOS Runtime is that it can launch the component-manager or some how interface with it.
